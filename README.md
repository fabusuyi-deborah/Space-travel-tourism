# Space Travel Tourism

This is my solution to the Frontend Mentor Space Tourism Challenge [[Frontend Mentor Space Tourism Challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/space-tourism-multipage-website-gRWj1URZ3)]. The goal was to replicate a space tourism company's multi-page website whilw following the design.

## About the Project

This project was an opportunity to practice building a real-world style multi-page website with reusable components. Instead of a single landing page, it required handling multiple layouts and states:

- Home – Hero introduction

- Destination – Planet info with tabbed navigation

- Crew – Crew profiles with navigation dots

- Technology – Tech details with numbered tabs

## Technologies Used

- React

- TypeScript

- Tailwind Css

- React Router

## My Focus

While building, I focused on:

- Responsiveness – Ensuring smooth layouts across mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints

- Type safety – Leveraging TypeScript to define props and avoid runtime errors

- Component reusability – Breaking down UI into smaller pieces (tabs, navigation, content cards)
